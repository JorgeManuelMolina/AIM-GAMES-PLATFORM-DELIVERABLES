All mockups regarding the AIM Games Platform core cases are contained within this folder. 
However, this link (https://xd.adobe.com/view/e8ef28c6-0fc4-40c4-66e6-b41df1e614e9-9ede/?fullscreen) 
contains an interactive mockup where all views are linked to each other and the different versions 
(web/mobile, English/Spanish) can be found. 
We highly encourage to check this for a better understanding of the application flow. 
To see what sections of the view are interactable you can click anywhere that is not a link, and the interactive areas will blink in blue.
If you are interested in adding comments on the mockups for our review, you can exit fullscreen mode by pressing Esc. 
You may check the last edition date for the mockups offered on the top left corner once out of fullscreen mode.
